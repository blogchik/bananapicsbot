# Code of Conduct

## Our commitment
We want this project to be a welcoming, harassment-free experience for everyone who participates, regardless of experience level, identity, or background.

## Expected behavior
- Be respectful and constructive.
- Assume good intent and ask clarifying questions.
- Provide thoughtful feedback focused on improving the project.
- Be mindful of others’ time (clear issues/PRs, minimal noise, helpful context).
- Respect privacy and do not share personal data or private logs without consent.

## Unacceptable behavior
- Harassment, hate speech, or discrimination.
- Sexualized language or unwelcome sexual attention.
- Threats, doxxing, stalking, or encouraging others to engage in harmful behavior.
- Trolling, personal attacks, or sustained disruption of discussions.
- Publishing confidential information (API keys, tokens, private chat logs, personal details).

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies in all project spaces (issues, pull requests, discussions, code review, and community channels) and also applies when representing the project in public spaces.

## Reporting
If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it.

- Preferred: open a private report via GitHub (if available for this repository), or contact the maintainers directly.
- If you are unsure who to contact, open an issue with minimal details and request a private channel.

When reporting, include:
- What happened (links/screenshots if safe)
- When it happened
- Who was involved
- Any context that may help

## Enforcement
Project maintainers will review reports, keep them as confidential as possible, and take any action they deem appropriate, including:
- Warning or guidance
- Comment/content removal
- Temporary or permanent ban from participation

## Appeals
If you believe an enforcement action was incorrect, contact the maintainers with additional context. Another maintainer (when available) will review the appeal.
